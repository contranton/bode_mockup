# bode_mockup
Small mock-up of graphical functions for EQ project using an off-the-shelf TFT display shield and an MSP430F5529 microcontroller.

## Explanation of our screen display idea


A C code was made attached with this handout to paint the 6 bands required for our design. The code segments with their on-screen results for what would be our prototype display is shown below. A time sequence of different gain levels was made for a 6 band display to be illustrated to the user as follows:


Initialize all bands to 0

![img1](./img/image1.png)

Raise first band to 50%

![img2](./img/image2.png)


Raise first band to 75%

![img3](./img/image3.png)


Raise second band to 40%

![img4](./img/image4.png)

Raise third band to 90%

![img5](./img/image5.png)

Raise fifth band to 50%

![img6](./img/image6.png)

Raise sixth band to 75%

![img7](./img/image7.png)

And finally, lower fifth band to 10%
