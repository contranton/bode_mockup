Small mock-up of graphical functions for EQ project

## Explanation of our screen display idea


A C code was made attached with this handout to paint the 6 bands required for our design. The code segments with their on-screen results for what would be our prototype display is shown below. A time sequence of different gain levels was made for a 6 band display to be illustrated to the user as follows:


Initialize all bands to 0

![img1](./img/image1)

Raise first band to 50%

![img2](./img/image2)


Raise first band to 75%

![img3](./img/image3)


Raise second band to 40%

![img4](./img/image4)

Raise third band to 90%

![img5](./img/image5)

Raise fifth band to 50%

![img6](./img/image6)

Raise sixth band to 75%

![img7](./img/image7)

And finally, lower fifth band to 10%

![img8](./img/image8)
